# logger-project

## Project Description

This project is my final project for IT Bootcamp. The requirements for
this project were to create a Spring-based web application that persists
users in a database and implements  role-based access control for certain
endpoints. The application should also allow users to register and log in,
and return a JWT token accordingly. Authenticated users with the "USER"
role should be able to create logs, retrieve their own logs, and delete them.
Authenticated users with the "ADMIN" role should be able to delete other users,
retrieve logs for a specific user, and change user passwords. To implement the
authentication and authorizationaspects of the application, I used Spring Security
with OAuth2 and JWT.

## My Experience

As a first-time user of the Spring framework, working on this project was both
interesting and challenging for me. I found myself in uncharted waters when it
came to learning about the Spring technology stack. However, throughout the course
of the project, I was able to gain a solid understanding of how to organize a 
Spring-based application and persist entities in a database. While I did not implement
OAuth2 properly due to lack of time (or knowledge), I was able to create a TokenProvider 
that generated JWTs on my own. Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this project and
learned a great deal in the process.
